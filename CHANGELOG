First Data's Global Gateway documentation is not known for being clear and
easy to understand.  Page 28 of the API User Manual says that setting
orderoptions/ordertype/result to "good" will give an approved response in
test mode.  However, what they don't indicate is that orders processed
against the staging server (for testing) that have a result of "good"
will not be included in the reporting available via the Virtual Terminal.
Thus, it's very hard to test any code you have written and verify that
the gateway actually received the transaction and the data you expected.

The one-line patch I committed just changes orderoptions/ordertype/result
to "LIVE" for transactions processed in test mode and live mode.
